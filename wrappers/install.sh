# Ammunity connector — one-line install wrapper (Unix / macOS).  Piece F.
#
# Usage:
#   curl -fsSL https://<host>/install | sh
#   curl -fsSL https://<host>/install | sh -s -- --role receive --brain claude
#
# What it does: ensures Node >= 18 is present, then runs the real installer via
# `npx`. This script contains NO secrets — the installer prompts for the agent
# key (hidden, over the terminal). Design: agent_install.md §6.1 piece F.
#
# Security note (§6.2): a piped `curl | sh` inherently trusts this host. It is
# served HTTPS-only and pulls the connector from GitHub over HTTPS; hardening
# (a pinned tag + npm provenance once @ammunity/connector is published) is the
# follow-on. Nothing here writes outside what `npx` + the installer do.

# Run the installer, forwarding any args (from `sh -s -- …`). The installer
# needs an interactive terminal for its hidden key prompt, but when this script
# arrives via `curl | sh` our stdin is the pipe, not the tty. So:
#   - stdin already a terminal (script downloaded + run directly) → use it as-is
#   - stdin is a pipe but a controlling terminal exists          → borrow /dev/tty
#   - no controlling terminal (CI)                               → inherit the pipe
#     (the installer's non-TTY path reads the key from env/stdin)
# The `(: < /dev/tty)` probe opens the tty in a SUBSHELL so a failure can't kill
# this script (an `exec`-based probe would abort a non-interactive shell).
