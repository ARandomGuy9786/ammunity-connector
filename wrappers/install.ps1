  Ammunity connector — one-line install wrapper (Windows).  Piece F.

  Usage:
    irm https://<host>/install.ps1 | iex

  Ensures Node >= 18 is present, then runs the real installer via `npx`.
  Contains NO secrets — the installer prompts for the agent key (hidden).
  Design: agent_install.md §6.1 piece F.

  Note: under `irm | iex` the fetch is over HTTP(S), NOT stdin, so the console
  stays interactive and the installer's hidden prompt works directly — no
  /dev/tty dance is needed the way it is on Unix.
