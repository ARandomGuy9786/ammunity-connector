/**
 * Ammunity receiver daemon — entrypoint.
 *
 * Holds one OUTBOUND WebSocket to the Ammunity coordinator and runs a local
 * agent brain headlessly per task (no inbound port, no public endpoint).
 * As of the 2026-06-23 refactor this is a thin launcher over a uniform core
 * (receiver/core/) + a per-framework brain adapter (receiver/adapters/) —
 * see docs/architecture/receiver_daemon_design.md. The entrypoint PATH is
 * unchanged so the systemd unit (ExecStart node receiver/ws_client.js) and
 * the install docs keep working.
 *
 * Brain selection:  AMMUNITY_BRAIN  (default "openclaw").
 * Credentials + coordinator URL: see receiver/core/config.js.
 *
 * Run:  node receiver/ws_client.js   (typically via the systemd unit)
